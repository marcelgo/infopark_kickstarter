Infopark Kickstarter provides generators and rake tasks to quickly setup or enhance an
[Infopark](http://infopark.de) Ruby on Rails project. All generated code
represents a working example, but can be fully customized within the application.


## Installation and Usage

Please visit our Dev Center to get the
[latest installation and usage information](https://dev.infopark.net/kickstarter).


## Testing

There are two types of tests. First there are rspec tests of the Infopark Kickstarter
engine. You can run these tests by simply calling:

    $ rake spec

There are also integration tests, that can be run by:

    $ rake test:integration

In order to run the tests successfully, you need to create a ```config/local.yml``` file and put in your
test project data. See [local.yml.template](https://github.com/infopark/infopark_kickstarter/blob/master/config/local.yml.template)
for what is needed exactly. The integration tests create an entire new application execute
```rails generate cms:kickstart``` and run a few other generators and then execute the tests of the
newly created application.


## Changelog

See [Changelog](https://github.com/infopark/infopark_kickstarter/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for more
details.


## Contributing

We would be very happy and thankful if you open new issues in order to further improve Infopark
Kickstarter. If you want to go a step further and extend the functionality or fix a problem, you can
do so any time by following the steps below.

1. Signup for a [free Infopark account](http://www.infopark.de/) and setup a test CRM
   and CMS component in the Infopark console.

2. Fork and clone the Infopark Kickstarter GitHub repository.

        git clone git@github.com:_username_/infopark_kickstarter.git
        cd infopark_kickstarter

3. We suggest using [rbenv](https://github.com/sstephenson/rbenv/). Anyway, compare your local Ruby
   version with the version given in `.ruby-version` and install it if necessary.

        ruby --version

3. Download the configuration files for your Ruby on Rails application from the Infopark console and copy them to your project's `config` folder.

        config/rails_connector.yml
        config/custom_cloud.yml


4. Create the bundle and run all test to make sure everything is working before you add your own
   changes. You find some more details about testing above in the __Testing__ section.

        bundle
        rake spec
        rake test:integration

5. Create your feature branch and create a pull request for the `develop` branch. Please take a
   look at the already existing generators and rake tasks to get an impression of our coding style
   and the general architecture.

6. We are using the [GitHub Styleguides](https://github.com/styleguide) and would prefer if you
   could stick to it.
